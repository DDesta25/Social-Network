  ## Description
  
  This project was creating Users, thoughts and adding reactions, and friends. Once you fill out the routes and the models it should run properly on insomnia and it should show GET and POST properly in the url for each one. It also allows you to create a friend and delete a friend. The same thing with adding a reaction and deleting the reaction.
